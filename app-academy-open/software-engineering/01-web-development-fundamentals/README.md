## Vocabulary

- **Active Learning**: Taking notes, testing out code samples in the terminal, asking questions and playing with code to find answers, pausing to summarize what you just read or learned
- **Passive Learning**: Reading or viewing a lesson in one shot without pausing, skimming examples without trying them out yourself, not asking any questions, unable to summarize or explain
- **Spaced Repetition**: Reviewing and practicing skills over time
- **George Polya**: came up with the understand, plan, execute, improve steps to solving any problem. The final step is to take a step back if you get stuck.
- **MDN Web Docs**: MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) is a collection of web development resources.
- **JavaScript Console**: `console.log()` is available to log data to the browser's console or to the terminal.
- **Static Content**: is loaded by the browser and doesn't change (except when the page is reloaded)
- **Dynamic Content**: is loaded by the browser and can be modified in response to user interactions or other events without requiring a page reload.
- **Asynchronous**: Mulitple tasks can be running at once - which prevents each task from being required to wait for other tasks to complete (if the tasks are unrelated)
- **Variable Types**: Number (can do +, -, *, /, %), Boolean (true/false - can do !, &&, ||), String (can do `.length`, delineate with quotes, double quotes, or backticks, index into with square brackets `[]`, indexes start at zero (not one), find character with `.indexOf()`, can be concatenated by adding `+` )
- **DeMorgan's Law**: `!(A || B)` is equivalent to `!A && !B` and `!(A && B)` is equivalent to `!A || !B`
-  **Variable declaration**: the act of introducing the variable to the environment (use `var`, `let` or `const`)
-  **Variable initialization**: assigns a value to a variable (use `=`)
-  **Undefined**: the contents of a variable which has been declared but not initialized (variable is empty)
- **Assignment Shorthand**: shortened notation for changing the value of a variable (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `\=`, `%=`)
- **NaN**: Not a Number. The result of attempting to use a non-numeric variable for a numeric computation.
- **Concatenation**: joining strings together into a single string using the `+` operator
- **A function**:  is a set of code that will run when called
- **function definition** consists of the function keyword, followed by three things: The name of the function. A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses ( ). The code to be run when this function is run, enclosed in curly braces { }.
- **Parameters** are comma separated variables specified as part of a function's declaration
- **Arguments** are values passed to the function when it is invoked.
- **control** flow is the order in which instructions are executed within a program.
- **DRY** - don't repeat yourself!


## Tips on asking a great question

- 15 minute rule: Ask a question if you've been stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes
- Try it out in a REPL: If you are curious/unsure about how a line of code will execute, try it out in a REPL
- Take time formulating your question: A good question is specific, clear, concise, and shows you put work into it
- Use a search engine: Look up your question to see if someone else asked a similar question to you and got an answer
- Use official documentation: Explore documentation like MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) for questions about syntax or usage of an operation or function
- Ask an instructor: Ask your formulated question to an instructor during a discussion
- Ask your peers: Ask your formulated question during a study circle



## Summary

You can't just do some parts and skip others - everything in the program is designed to work together!

My expectations for this curriculum are that it will be challenging in parts, will require the equivalent of 24 weeks of fulltime effort, and will used spaced repetition and other active learning techniques to promote long term scalable learning.

Ask good questions and approach problems methodically.
